Needed packages: git, hyprland, kitty, then run this commad from inside base hyprland
```shell
git clone https://github.com/HyprCandy/hyprcandyinstall.git && cd hyprcandyinstall
```
followed by
```shell
chmod +x Hyprcandy_installer.sh && ./Hyprcandy_installer.sh
```
The script can also be rerun to change between Fish and Zsh, restore default dotfiles settings or update dotfiles but it's recommended to git clone a fresh script.
