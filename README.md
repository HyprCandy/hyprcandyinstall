The script works from TTY if on a free OS install without a DE on and also from base Hyprland or Gnome which is the only recommended secondary DE for this setup.

Needed packages: git, hyprland, kitty, then run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/HyprCandy/hyprcandyinstall.git && cd hyprcandyinstall
```
followed by:
```shell
bash Hyprcandy_installer.sh
```
