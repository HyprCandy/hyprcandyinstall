Needed packages: git, hyprland, kitty, then run this commad from inside base hyprland
```shell
git clone https://github.com/HyprCandy/hyprcandyinstall.git && cd hyprcandyinstall
```
followed by
```shell
chmod +x Hyprcandy_installer.sh && ./Hyprcandy_installer.sh
```
The script may also work from TTY but with an error when it tries to reload Hyprland. Shouldn't be an issue after restarting.



[INFO] üè† Clean Home Directory:

‚Ä¢ You can delete the HyprCandy images folder since it's copied into Pictures

‚Ä¢ The hyprcandyinstall folder can also be deleted since it only takes a few seconds to git clone again
