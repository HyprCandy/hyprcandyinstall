Needed packages: git, hyprland, kitty and a browser.
Run the commad below
```shell
git clone https://github.com/HyprCandy/hyprcandyinstall.git && cd hyprcandyinstall
```
followed by
```shell
chmod +x Hyprcandy_installer.sh && ./Hyprcandy_installer.sh
```
The script can also be rerun to change between Fish and Zsh although for Zsh you'll need to delete the ".hyprcandy" folder 
in order for the default .zshrc file to be reloaded
