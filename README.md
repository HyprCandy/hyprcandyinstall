Needed packages: git, hyprland, kitty, then run this commad from inside base hyprland
```shell
git clone https://github.com/HyprCandy/hyprcandyinstall.git && cd hyprcandyinstall
```
followed by
```shell
chmod +x Hyprcandy_installer.sh && ./Hyprcandy_installer.sh
```
The script may also work from TTY but with an error when it tries to reload Hyprland. Shouldn't be an issue after restarting. 

# Post Install 

Configuration management tips:

‚Ä¢ Your Hyprcandy configs are in: ~/.hyprcandy/

‚Ä¢ To update configs: cd ~/.hyprcandy && git pull && stow */

‚Ä¢ To set custom keybinds and other Hyprland settings, create the "hyprcustom" folder in "~/.config" waith a "custom.conf" file

Then in "~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf" uncomment the line "#source = ~/.config/hyprcustom/custom.conf"

‚Ä¢  Toggle "SUPER + CTRL + K" for the rofi-keybinds menu
